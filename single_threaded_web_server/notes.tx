1. Creating a Buffered Reader:
        let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&mut stream);
        Purpose: Wraps stream in a BufReader for efficient reading with buffering.
        Usage: Improves performance by reducing the number of I/O operations.

2. Reading and Processing HTTP Request:
        let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
            .lines()
            .map(|result| result.unwrap())
            .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
            .collect();

        buf_reader.lines(): Creates an iterator over lines from the stream.
        .map(|result| result.unwrap()): Converts Result<String, Error> to String, panicking on error.
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty()): Collects lines until an empty line (end of headers) is encountered.
        .collect(): Gathers the lines into a Vec<String>.

3. Defining the HTTP Response:
        let response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n";
        Purpose: Specifies a basic HTTP 200 OK response.
        Structure: "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n" indicates a successful request with no content.

4. Sending the Response:
        stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
        response.as_bytes(): Converts the response string to a byte array.
        stream.write_all(...): Sends the byte array to the client.
        .unwrap(): Panics if writing to the stream fails (for simplicity; in real code, handle errors properly).
